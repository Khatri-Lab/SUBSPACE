# SUBSPACE
The SUBSPACE consortium was founded to identify the consensus biologic endotypes in sepsis. Consortium members have shared transcriptomic, proteomic, and clinical data from their respective sepsis biobanks.

The key goals of the SUBSPACE consortium in using this data is to:
1) Validate and test available sepsis endotyping schema
2) Integrate these sepsis endotyping schema to identify commonalities and develop overarching consensus endotypes
3) Evaluate the clinical implications of these endotypes
4) Identify the underlying biology of these endotypes by integrating multi-omic data
5) Develop a simplified consensus endotyping scores to be developed into diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tests
